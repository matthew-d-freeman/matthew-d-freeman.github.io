## Overview
For this project, I was tasked to design a system that could read the temperature of different environments and save it to an SD card. For this I was given a SD card shield that I could just slot ontop of the Arduino Uno. I was to save an excel file onto the SD card with all the temperature information needed to then analyze using RStudio.

## Parts Used
- Arduino Uno
- Temperature & Humidity Sensor (DHT11)
- Seeed Studio SD Card Shield V4
- Wires

## Summary

This project went well except for trying to use the SD card I culdn't get it to work at first no matter what I did. I had to unisntall the Arduino IDE and reinstall it for it to finally work. Other than that, the temprature readings and commiting them to a file worked properly.
